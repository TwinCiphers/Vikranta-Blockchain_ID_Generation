# 🔧 DIAGNOSTIC REPORT & FIXES APPLIED

## ✅ **All Systems Operational**

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Status:** All critical issues resolved

---

## 🔍 **Issues Found & Fixed:**

### 1. ❌ **CORS Error (FIXED)** ✅

**Problem:**
```
⚠️  CORS blocked origin: https://localhost
❌ Error: Not allowed by CORS
```

**Root Cause:**
- Backend CORS configuration didn't include `https://localhost`
- Only allowed `http://localhost:3000`, `http://localhost:8080`
- HTTPS requests from nginx were being blocked

**Fix Applied:**
Updated `backend/middleware/corsConfig.js` to include:
```javascript
const allowedOrigins = [
    'http://localhost:3000',
    'http://localhost:8080',
    'http://localhost',         // ✅ ADDED
    'https://localhost',        // ✅ ADDED
    'https://localhost:443',    // ✅ ADDED
    'http://127.0.0.1:3000',
    'http://127.0.0.1:8080',
    'http://127.0.0.1',         // ✅ ADDED
    'https://127.0.0.1',        // ✅ ADDED
];
```

**Verification:**
- Backend restarted successfully
- No more CORS errors in logs
- All services healthy

## 🌐 **Network Architecture:**

```
Browser (https://localhost)
    ↓
Nginx (Port 443) - HTTPS Termination
    ↓
Backend (Port 3000) - Express Server
    ↓
Blockchain (Port 8545) - Ganache
```

### Request Flow:
1. **Browser → Nginx:** HTTPS (TLS 1.2/1.3 encrypted)
2. **Nginx → Backend:** HTTP (internal Docker network, secure)
3. **Backend → Blockchain:** HTTP (internal Docker network, secure)
