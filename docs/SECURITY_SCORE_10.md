## 🚀 Implementation Stats

### Data Usage
- alpine/openssl Docker image: ~10 MB (one-time)
- nginx:alpine Docker image: Already cached
- **Total additional data:** ~10 MB

### Time Taken
- SSL certificate generation: 2 minutes
- nginx.conf creation: 1 minute
- docker-compose.yml update: 1 minute
- Container restart and verification: 2 minutes
- **Total time:** ~6 minutes

### Browser Behavior
⚠️ **Expected:** Browser will show "Not Secure" or "Your connection is not private" warning because the certificate is self-signed.

**To Proceed:**
1. Click "Advanced" or "Details"
2. Click "Proceed to localhost (unsafe)" or similar
3. This is **normal behavior** for self-signed certificates

## 🧪 Testing HTTPS

### Test 1: HTTP Redirect
```bash
# Should return 301 redirect
curl -I http://localhost/api/tourist/health
```

**Expected Output:**
```
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: https://localhost/api/tourist/health
```

### Test 2: HTTPS Connection
```bash
# Access via browser (accept certificate warning)
https://localhost/api/tourist/health
```

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-30T15:41:29.000Z"
}
```

### Test 3: Container Status
```bash
docker-compose ps
```

**Expected Output:**
```
tourist-nginx    nginx:alpine    Up    0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp, 0.0.0.0:443->443/tcp
```
