function closeModal() {
    document.getElementById('verificationModal').style.display = 'none';
    currentTouristId = null;
    // Reset buttons
    document.getElementById('approveBtn').style.display = 'inline-block';
    document.getElementById('downloadPvcBtn').style.display = 'none';
}
```

5. Enters reason → Tourist rejected with tracking
6. Modal closes → Pending list refreshes
7. ✅ Tourist removed from list
```

### Tourist Dashboard Flow
```
1. Tourist registers → Receives unique ID
2. Opens dashboard → https://localhost/dashboard.html?uniqueId=ABC123
3. Sees "Pending" status → Waiting for approval
4. Authority approves → Backend verifies on blockchain
5. After ~10 seconds → Dashboard polls and detects change
6. ✅ Notification appears: "Verification Complete!"
7. ✅ Status changes to "Verified & Active"
8. ✅ QR code loads automatically
9. ✅ PVC download button enabled
