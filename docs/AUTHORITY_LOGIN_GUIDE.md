# üîê Authority Login Guide

## Quick Login (Easiest Method)

**Just open this page in your browser:**
```
https://localhost/quick-authority-login.html
```

Click the "üöÄ Login as Authority" button and you'll be automatically logged in!

---

## Manual Login Steps

If you prefer to use the regular login page:

### 1. Open Authority Login Page
```
https://localhost/authority-login.html
```

### 2. Connect Your MetaMask Wallet
- Click "Connect MetaMask Wallet"
- Approve the connection in MetaMask
- Use this authority address: `0x9bBD3535c5582A4b15a529Bb3794688728988D41`

### 3. Enter the Authority Passphrase
```
vikrantaTBS$2025
```

### 4. Click "Verify & Login"

## Why Was I Getting "Access Denied"?

The error can happen due to several reasons:
- **Invalid Passphrase**: You entered the wrong passphrase
- **Not an Authority**: Your wallet address isn't registered as an authority in the smart contract
- **Contract Redeployed**: The contract was redeployed and old addresses are no longer valid

**Solution**: 
1. Use the correct passphrase: `vikrantaTBS$2025`
2. Use the deployer address: `0x9bBD3535c5582A4b15a529Bb3794688728988D41`
3. This address is automatically registered as an authority when the contract is deployed

## Adding More Authorities

If you want to add more authority addresses:

### Method 1: Use the Script
```bash
node add-authority.js
```

This will show all available accounts and instructions to add new authorities.

### Method 2: Modify the Script
Edit `add-authority.js` and uncomment the code at the bottom:
```javascript
const newAuthority = accounts[1]; // or any address
const tx = await touristRegistryContract.methods
    .addAuthority(newAuthority)
    .send({ from: admin, gas: 3000000 });
```

Then run: `node add-authority.js`
