## 🐛 Known Issues (Non-Critical)

### 1. Old Document with Truncated Hash
```
Status: ⚠️ Known Issue
Tourist ID: EJ6mrfQ5fy
Hash: Qm5wZ7UYg3rZRe71aylV2JVOuPceDw (30 chars)
Solution: Re-upload document to get 46-char hash
Impact: Low - only affects old uploads
```

### 2. Mock IPFS (Development Mode)
```
Status: ⚠️ By Design
Current: Mock 46-character hashes
Documents: Not on real IPFS network
Solution: Configure Pinata/Infura for production
Impact: Low - works for development/testing
```

### 3. Self-Signed SSL Certificate
```
Status: ⚠️ Expected
Current: Self-signed certificate
Browser: Shows "Not Secure" warning
Solution: Use Let's Encrypt for production
Impact: Low - normal for development
```
