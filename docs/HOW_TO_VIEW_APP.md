4. Click **"Advanced"**
5. You'll see more text appear
6. Click the link that says **"Proceed to localhost (unsafe)"** or **"Continue to localhost"**

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "I can't see anything, just a blank page"
**Solution:** 
1. Make sure you clicked "Proceed to localhost" after the warning
2. Try refreshing the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
3. Check browser console (F12) for errors

### Problem: "The warning page won't let me proceed"
**Solution:**
- **Chrome/Edge:** Look for "Advanced" text at the bottom of the warning
- **Firefox:** Look for "Advanced..." button
- The button might be small and easy to miss!

### Problem: "I clicked proceed but still see warnings"
**Solution:**
- This is normal! The padlock icon will have a warning symbol
- Your connection IS still encrypted and secure
- The warning is just about the certificate not being from a trusted authority

### Problem: "Page shows 'Cannot connect'"
**Solution:**
1. Check containers are running:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```
2. Should see nginx with ports 443:443 and 80:80
3. If not, restart:
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart nginx
   ```

## 🎥 Visual Guide

### What You'll See in Chrome:

**Step 1 - Warning Screen:**
```
⚠️ Your connection isn't private
Attackers might be trying to steal your information from 
localhost (for example, passwords, messages, or credit cards).

NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID

[Advanced] ← CLICK HERE
```

**Step 2 - After Clicking Advanced:**
```
⚠️ Your connection isn't private
Attackers might be trying to steal...

This server could not prove that it is localhost; its 
security certificate is not trusted by this computer's 
operating system. This may be caused by a misconfiguration 
or an attacker intercepting your connection.

Proceed to localhost (unsafe) ← CLICK HERE
```

**Step 3 - Application Loads:**
```
🔒 https://localhost (⚠️ Not secure)
